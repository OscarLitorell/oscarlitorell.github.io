        <h3>Throttle lever</h3>

            <p>
                This is a throttle lever specifically designed for Elite Dangerous, but can be used in other flight simulators as well. It is in blender around the Leo Bodnar BU0826A board, and features one major thrust axis, 8 pushbuttons, one small thumbstick with built-in pushbutton, and 2 rotary encoders. It is 3D-printed in PETG (polyethylene).

        <h3>Mini submarine</h3>
        <hr class="maker filled">
        <div class="separate">

            <p>
                This is a project that I have started working on. My goal is to build a working submarine, where the pitch is controlled by shifting weights inside the sub. You can see ethe pipe pieces that I am going use to build it, along with the laser-cut piece of acrylic glass that will be used for the window. The plan is that it's going to be controlled with a tether (an ethernet cable), which hopefully means that it will be possible to transmit video as well.
